# Identifying Syringe Litter Service Request Hotspots in New York City and Predicting Their Resolution
This project investigates the New York City OpenData's 311 Service Request data set. It applies a Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise model to identify the locations of dense areas, or hotspots, of syringe litter service requests. Then, the hotspots and the features in the data set are utilized in regression and classification models to understand the influential features in determining the service requests' resolution behavior. The paper identifies 30 syringe litter service request hotspots, and the random forest regressor and random forest classifier identify the time of day an individual creates a service request to be most influential in predicting the agency's resolution behavior, providing insights for possible placements of syringe disposal infrastructure and cleaning crews.
